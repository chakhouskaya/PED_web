### Procedure

0. Install git
1. Create an account at https://github.com/
2. Fork (Fork button) repo https://github.com/hanel/PED_web into your repository
3. Clone your repo (Clone or download button) - Copy the *.git address
4. In R Studio, create a new project from Version Control and insert *.git
5. In R Studio, use the Pull button to download the repository
6. Use ctrl + shift + b to build a web page (or the Build tab)

7. Create a new RMarkdown document in RStudio
8. Name it for example with your monogram
9. Leave the head in shape (name edit)


```{}
---
title: "Your name"
---

```

10. Write some introductory text in the file
11. Edit file `_site.yml` to add your presentation in the menu (in the header section)

```{}
 - text: Presentation
    menu:
    - text: Jan Petr
      href: jp.html
```

add another line `-text: Your name` and `href: link_of_your_file.html` (remember that although you are editing a link as `link_of_your_file.Rmd`, the compiled file will appear as `link_of_your_file.html`)

12. Build the project on the Git tab to register changes (Commit) - be sure to add a message about what you did
13. Press the push button to upload the project to github
14. Create a new pull request on github

15. Repeat steps 12-13, if you want to work with a repository on another computer, you can synchronize it with the pull button

16. Deliver your page.

17. On the main page  (`index.Rmd`) , fill in your name, some representative image and abstract for your work. Note: The image should have a width of 200px - you can either edit it in the image editor or paste the image using `<img src="img/YOUR_IMAGE" style="width:200px"/>`

18. Push to github to create a pull request

* If you want to synchronize your repository with the original repository (https://github.com/hanel/PED_web), to which your classmates may have already contributed, try using the following script

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = -2}
library(git2r)
repo = repository('/home/hanel/PED/PED_web/')
repo = repository('cesta_k_vasemu_repozitari_v_pocitaci')
if (!"upstream" %in% remotes(repo)) remote_add(repo, 'upstream', 'https://github.com/hanel/PED_web.git')
fetch(repo, 'upstream')
merge('master', 'upstream')
```
